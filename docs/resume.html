              <p>The Decathlon Hong Kong Tech Team oversees the Hong Kong specific parts of the ecommerce website, the core being implemented by a separated team in France. The team, however, has autonomy on local initiatives to design, implement and run local applications used externally or internally.</p>

<p>As a Tech Lead, I help the team to shorten development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality through DevOps best practices. I introduced to the team concepts like TDD, static code analysis and code reviews, responsibilized the teammates with application ownerships (“you build it, you run it”), standardized and automated parts of the CI/CD pipeline and setup application monitoring tools.</p>

<p>I collaborate as well with the Product Owners to provide the technical vision of the applications and suggest alternative technical solutions and take the responsibility for direction in terms of project architecture and technical choices.</p>

<p>As an Engineering Manager since October 2020, I manage a team of 6 developers, supporting them as they develop their role and their skills. I coordinate the appraisal process and manage teammates recruitment. I convey Decathlon’s project, purpose and vision within the team through annual mission definition.</p>

                <h5>Description</h5>
                <p>Decathlon Plus is an initiative to test the business regarding sport retail marketplaces from sellers onboarding to shipments follow-up.</p>

<p>This marketplace website was bootstrapped using a Ruby-on-Rails ecommerce framework called Solidus that provides the core functionalities (product listing page, product detail page, checkout funnel, payment integration, etc). The flexible properties of the framework allowed us to easily extend the data model to include data related to sellers and their brands. A new visual branding was created by our Design Team and applied to our UI by slightly adapting Bootstrap with a custom theme.</p>

<p>The decision to choose a framework not completely adapted to our need instead of building an application from scratch was right. We managed to roll out a marketplace (including partnerships, business development, communication, finance) in a few months and we are now already learning from the market.</p>

            <h4>Recommendation Gateway</h4>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-xs-8">
                <h5>Description</h5>
                <p>The Recommendation Gateway is designed to enable the Data Scientists to continuously apply their products recommendation models to the local ecommerce website. It consists of an endpoint where the Data Scientists bulk upload the products recommendation for every Decathlon Hong Kong member. When one of those members visit the ecommerce website homepage, a query is sent to the application API with the member unique identifier which responds with recommended products information.</p>

<p>The decision to request the Recommendation Gateway API from the frontend was made to improve the autonomy and therefore the delivery performance of the Hong Kong Decathlon Tech Team. The ecommerce website being developed by a separated team in the company’s home country, the local team only has the hand on the frontend side.</p>

<p>The main challenges of the Recommendation Gateway were to provide a convenient way for the Data Scientists to maintain the uploaded data and to serve the products information with a low response time. The source of products information is a legacy internal API with an average response time of 2sec per product. Using functional programming with Elixir made parallelization straightforward to implement and using Redis performant I/O and Time To Live strategy for caching allowed us to reach an average response time of 800ms for 6 products per query.</p>

              <p>Appysport (shut down in 2020) was a start-up based in Hong Kong aiming to facilitate sports practice in Hong Kong with technology. Appysport started with tennis and watersports to make them more accessible to the many and wants to make it possible for sports lovers to easily propose or join activities, invite their friends, hire coaches, or even rent equipment.</p>

<p>As a Senior Developer, my role was to design and build the Appysport platform, work closely with the product managers to provide technical solutions and integrate the existing external platforms to our own backoffice.</p>

                <p>The Appysport platform aggregated multiple “macro-services” organised around multiple sports such as watersports, tennis (shutdown end 2019) and fitness. Shopify is used to host data, display the services (classes, lessons, rentals, etc) rendered with a custom Liquid template and handle the checkout process.</p>

<p>An ETL built with Elixir served as bridge between the data provider Anybuddy and Shopify. It was designed to be fast, lightweight, fault-tolerant and mitigate Shopify API rate limits. Elixir pre-built scheduler served as an integrated CRON service.</p>

<p>Bookings’ followup emails (confirmation to the customer/partner, cancelation, instructions, etc) was done with a Ruby-on-Rails application. A custom Domain Specific Language (DSL) was designed to simplify the configuration of automated emails and their integration with Sendgrid.</p>

<h4>TripAdvisor Integration App</h4>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-8">
    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>
      This application helps any property manager of BookingSync to push to TripAdvisor platform all the availabilities of their rentals and the estimated price per day.
      However, the final price paid by the traveler was sometimes different than the direct price computed by BookingSync because of delays between refreshes of rental prices and discounts related to the length of stay.
    </p>

    <p>
      I worked closely with the TripAdvisor technical team to implement an API endpoint based on their specifications. This endpoint was later used by TripAdvisor to display on their website the live rate for a rental according to the length of stay and the number of guests. The estimated number of requests during a peak day was 7,500 and so far, this endpoint has respected the SLA defined by TripAdvisor:
      <ul>
        <li>maintain less than 500ms of median response time</li>
        <li>maintain less than 1.5s of response time for 90% of requests</li>
        <li>return a successful response for at least 99.9% of unique requests</li>
      </ul>

<h4>BookingSync Notification Center App</h4>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-8">
    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>
      The Notification app is critical in the vacation rental process as it handles all the emailing of check-in and check-out details, contracts, payment reminders and other information to the travelers. It relies heavily on background jobs and real-time constraints. Being the application I worked the most on, it was released 2 years before I started working on it. I covered all parts of the app, including:
      <ul>
        <li>Improve UX by reducing risks of typos (especially for email address errors)</li>
        <li>Prevent emails from being sent twice by refactoring SQL queries</li>
        <li>Implement soft-deletion feature for all DB records for data recovery and audit</li>
        <li>Setup healthcheck that triggers alerts when delay sending notifications is too high</li>
        <li>Implement a "retry later" feature when Mandrill's servers are down</li>
        <li>Fix all warnings and stylecheck offenses</li>
        <li>Add pagination to index pages and remove n+1 queries to reduce request time</li>

      Rebuilt and enhanced the leading social platform in Hong Kong that connects families and domestic helpers.
      Being the second person to join this social startup, my role was to analyze the business needs, provide solutions adjusted to the users' constraints.
      In addition, I had the responsibility to keep the website up and scalable by delivering clean, maintainable and tested codebase.
    </p>

    <p>
      The website attracts more than 8000 users per day. The startup itself was rewarded in Hong Kong for its social impact and was the only Asian finalist in a purposed-based contest supported by the UN Foundation.

    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>
      Redesigned the whole application architecture, developed the new platform, managed the transition from the previous website, secured the payment workflow and integrated new business features. Business needs are specified directly by the CEO and then designed and implemented by me. The development cycle is agile following a TDD process, each feature is tested and developed piece by piece and deployed as soon as possible in production.
    </p>

    <p>
      The website users are present in 10 countries and a large part is using the previous generation smartphones. To handle these constraints, we built the website by using responsive design techniques available on modern and legacy browsers. The core of the architecture is a Ruby-on-Rails application (MVC, REST) associated with the "best for the job" tools.

    <p>
      DoctHeure is a web application that allows medical practitioners to easily automate the secretary's tasks. The patient can take an appointment on the web application or by phone call. An email and/or an SMS is sent the day before the appointment. The features can be configured by the practitioner to fit his needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The application has been developed by myself and the open-source community through a rigorous development method. The kanban process was used to list and prioritize tasks and keep a trace of the deployment cycle (test, development, staging, production). The TDD process was used to keep the application clean and to avoid any regressions.

      In mission at Caceis Fund Administration as Software Engineer, as Lead Developer of the Financial Reporting Team (3 developers), I was in charge of the enhancement of new features of the business core software as IFRS7 risk calculation or third-party software StatPro integration. I designed financial reporting templates and populated them with stored procedures that fetched data in a data warehouse.

<h4>IFRS7 Risk Calculation</h4>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-8">
    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>
      The IFRS7 notation is a value from 1(good) to 3(bad) that estimates the risk level of each asset of a financial portfolio (hedge fund). The value is weight by rules like for example the nationality of the fund or the type of asset. Each fund holder can choose the rules they want to apply.
    </p>

    <p>
      The existing business core software had a Service Oriented Architecture so the feature was implemented as a web service and "plug" in the existing system. The service was triggered by a UI through an API. The UI also allowed the user to create and to weight rules to a portfolio. A specific algorithm was designed to reduce databases I/O and avoid unnecessary operations.
