Decathlon Plus represents an innovative venture aimed at exploring the sport retail marketplace business, covering the entire spectrum from seller onboarding to shipment tracking.

The creation of this marketplace website was initiated using a Ruby-on-Rails e-commerce framework known as Solidus, which furnished the core functionalities essential for an e-commerce platform, including product listing pages, product details, checkout processes, payment integrations, and more. The adaptable nature of this framework allowed us to seamlessly extend the data model to incorporate critical data pertaining to sellers and their respective brands.

To enhance the user experience, our Design Team introduced a fresh visual branding concept, which was seamlessly integrated into our user interface through slight customizations of Bootstrap using a tailored theme.

The strategic decision to leverage an existing framework, even if not entirely tailored to our specific needs, proved to be prudent. In just a matter of months, we successfully launched a comprehensive marketplace, encompassing critical aspects such as partnerships, business development, communications, and financial operations. As a result, we have swiftly immersed ourselves in the market and are actively learning from this experience.
