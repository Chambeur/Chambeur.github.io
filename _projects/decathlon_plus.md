Decathlon Plus is an initiative to test the business regarding sport retail marketplaces from sellers onboarding to shipments follow-up.

This marketplace website was bootstrapped using a Ruby-on-Rails ecommerce framework called Solidus that provides the core functionalities (product listing page, product detail page, checkout funnel, payment integration, etc). The flexible properties of the framework allowed us to easily extend the data model to include data related to sellers and their brands. A new visual branding was created by our Design Team and applied to our UI by slightly adapting Bootstrap with a custom theme.

The decision to choose a framework not completely adapted to our need instead of building an application from scratch was right. We managed to roll out a marketplace (including partnerships, business development, communication, finance) in a few months and we are now already learning from the market.
