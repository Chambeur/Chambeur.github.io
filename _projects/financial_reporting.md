A financial reporting is 2 pages of technical information about a financial portfolio. The project was to automate monthly reporting of specific portfolios with informations saved in a datawarehouse. I used the software Actuate to design the reporting template and populated it trough stocked procedure.

Actuate design module is built on Visual Basic language. It allowed me to create DRY design component for templates (such as headers, footers, curves, tables).
