<h4>DoctHeure Web Application</h4>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-8">
    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>
      DoctHeure is a web application that allows medical practitioners to easily automate the secretary's tasks. The patient can take an appointment on the web application or by phone call. An email and/or an SMS is sent the day before the appointment. The features can be configured by the practitioner to fit his needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The application has been developed by myself and the open-source community through a rigorous development method. The kanban process was used to list and prioritize tasks and keep a trace of the deployment cycle (test, development, staging, production). The TDD process was used to keep the application clean and to avoid any regressions.
