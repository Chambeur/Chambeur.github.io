Rebuilt and enhanced the leading social platform in Hong Kong that connects families and domestic helpers.
Being the second person to join this social startup, my role was to analyze the business needs, provide solutions adjusted to the users' constraints.
In addition, I had the responsibility to keep the website up and scalable by delivering clean, maintainable and tested codebase.

The website attracts more than 8000 users per day. The startup itself was rewarded in Hong Kong for its social impact and was the only Asian finalist in a purposed-based contest supported by the UN Foundation.
