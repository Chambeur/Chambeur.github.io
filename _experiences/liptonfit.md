In mission at Caceis Fund Administration as Software Engineer, as Lead Developer of the Financial Reporting Team (3 developers), I was in charge of the enhancement of new features of the business core software as IFRS7 risk calculation or third-party software StatPro integration. I designed financial reporting templates and populated them with stored procedures that fetched data in a data warehouse.
