      Rebuilt and enhanced the leading social platform in Hong Kong that connects families and domestic helpers.
      Being the second person to join this social startup, my role was to analyze the business needs, provide solutions adjusted to the users' constraints.
      In addition, I had the responsibility to keep the website up and scalable by delivering clean, maintainable and tested codebase.
    </p>

    <p>
      The website attracts more than 8000 users per day. The startup itself was rewarded in Hong Kong for its social impact and was the only Asian finalist in a purposed-based contest supported by the UN Foundation.

    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>
      Redesigned the whole application architecture, developed the new platform, managed the transition from the previous website, secured the payment workflow and integrated new business features. Business needs are specified directly by the CEO and then designed and implemented by me. The development cycle is agile following a TDD process, each feature is tested and developed piece by piece and deployed as soon as possible in production.
    </p>

    <p>
      The website users are present in 10 countries and a large part is using the previous generation smartphones. To handle these constraints, we built the website by using responsive design techniques available on modern and legacy browsers. The core of the architecture is a Ruby-on-Rails application (MVC, REST) associated with the "best for the job" tools.
