Kactus is a marketplace for MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) venues. It is a B2B SaaS platform that connects event planners with venues. The platform enables event planners to search, compare, and book venues for their events, while also allowing venues to manage and receive bookings.

In 2022, Kactus merged with a competitor, Bird Office, to become the European leader in the MICE market. As the technical expert of Kactus' tech stack, I played a key role in integrating the Bird Office team. This involved conducting code reviews, engaging in technical discussions, and participating in pair programming sessions.

As an Engineering Manager, I lead the team in shortening the development life cycle and achieving continuous delivery with a focus on high software quality through DevOps best practices. I introduced concepts such as continuous deployment using Github Flow, standardized and automated components of the CI/CD pipeline, and implemented application monitoring tools. Through these processes and tools, I significantly reduced production errors and vulnerabilities, minimized tech support ticket volume, improved code quality, and increased test coverage.

I also actively participate in the recruitment process by conducting technical interviews and assessing the skills of potential new team members.

As a Tech Team Lead, I collaborate closely with Product Owners to provide the technical vision for our applications, propose alternative technical solutions, and take responsibility for project architecture and technical choices. Additionally, I manage a team of 1-2 developers and conduct regular 1-on-1 meetings to support their professional growth, assess their performance, and help them develop their skills.
