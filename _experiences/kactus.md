Kactus is a marketplace for MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions) venues. It is a B2B SaaS platform that connects event planners with venues. The platform allows event planners to search, compare and book venues for their events. It also allows venues to manage and receive bookings.

During the year 2022, Kactus merged with a competitor, Bird Office, to become the European leader of the MICE market. Being the technical expert of Kactus tech stack, I helped the team to integrate the Bird Office team with code reviews, technical discussions and pair programming sessions.

As a Engineering Manager, I help the team to shorten development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality through DevOps best practices. I introduced to the team concepts like continuous deployment with Github Flow, standardized and automated parts of the CI/CD pipeline and setup application monitoring tools.
Through processes and tools, I help the team to reduce the number of errors and vulnerabilities in production, reduce the number of tech support tickets, improve the code quality and test coverage.

Tech Team Lead, I collaborate as well with the Product Owners to provide the technical vision of the applications and suggest alternative technical solutions and take the responsibility for direction in terms of project architecture and technical choices.

I manage a team of developers (1 or 2), supporting them as they develop their role and their skills. I coordinate the appraisal process and manage teammates recruitment.
