BookingSync is a remote-based company with collaborators all around the world. It provides services to vacation rentals property managers through multiple in-house applications and external partner systems such as Airbnb, Booking.com and TripAdvisor. More than 20.000 rentals are managed in over 66 countries. More than 2.3 billion bookings were handled through Bookingsync.

As a Senior Developer, my role was to design more complex features and to oversee the work of other developers. I also had to keep applications under my scope up and running. Those applications had various business objectives:
- Notification Center app that triggers emails sent to travelers
- Owners portal app that facilitates communication between a property manager and the rental's owner
- TripAdvisor Integration app to help property manager oversee which rentals to push TripAdvisor platform
- Invoice app that generates invoices based on custom templates
- Website Builder, that generates fully functional rental booking websites automatically plugged to BookingSync

The stack being similar among the applications, I initialized the standardization of their README to cover installation, setup, development process, testing, deployment, and monitoring.

As a Team Leader, my role was to facilitate the communication between with other teams and also to smoother the organization within the team (4 developers & 2 customer supports).
