Appysport is a start-up based in Hong Kong aiming to facilitate sports practice in Hong Kong with technology. Appysport started with tennis and watersports to make them more accessible to the many and wants to make it possible for sports lovers to easily propose or join activities, invite their friends, hire coaches, or even rent equipment.

As a Senior Developer, my role is to design and build the Appysport platform, work closely with the product managers to provide technical solutions and integrate the existing external platforms to our own backoffice.
