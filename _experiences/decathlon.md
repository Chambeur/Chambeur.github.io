At Decathlon Hong Kong, the Tech Team is responsible for overseeing the Hong Kong-specific components of our e-commerce website, with the core functionalities developed by a separate team based in France. Despite this division, our team enjoys autonomy to conceptualize, implement, and maintain local applications used both internally and externally.

In my role as Tech Lead, I have played a pivotal role in streamlining our development life cycle and ensuring continuous delivery of high-quality software through the implementation of DevOps best practices. I introduced crucial concepts such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), static code analysis, and code reviews. I empowered team members by assigning application ownership ("you build it, you run it"), standardized and automated various components of our CI/CD pipeline, and established robust application monitoring tools.

I maintain close collaboration with Product Owners to provide a clear technical vision for our applications, offering alternative technical solutions when necessary. I also shoulder the responsibility for guiding project architecture and making informed technical choices.

Since assuming the role of Engineering Manager in October 2020, I have successfully managed a team of 6 developers, actively supporting their professional growth and skill development. My responsibilities include coordinating the appraisal process and leading recruitment efforts. Furthermore, I ensure alignment with Decathlon's mission, purpose, and vision by defining annual team missions.
