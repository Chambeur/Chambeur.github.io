The Decathlon Hong Kong Tech Team oversees the Hong Kong specific parts of the ecommerce website, the core being implemented by a separated team in France. The team, however, has autonomy on local initiatives to design, implement and run local applications used externally or internally.

As a Tech Lead, I help the team to shorten development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality through DevOps best practices. I introduced to the team concepts like TDD, static code analysis and code reviews, responsibilized the teammates with application ownerships ("you build it, you run it"), standardized and automated parts of the CI/CD pipeline and setup application monitoring tools.

I collaborate as well with the Product Owners to provide the technical vision of the applications and suggest alternative technical solutions and take the responsibility for direction in terms of project architecture and technical choices.

As an Engineering Manager since October 2020, I manage a team of 6 developers, supporting them as they develop their role and their skills. I coordinate the appraisal process and manage teammates recruitment. I convey Decathlon's project, purpose and vision within the team through annual mission definition.
